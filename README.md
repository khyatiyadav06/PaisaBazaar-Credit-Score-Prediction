# PaisaBazaar-Credit-Score-Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model to classify customer credit scores into three categories: **Poor**, **Standard**, and **Good**, using financial and behavioral features. The final deployed model is based on **XGBoost**, offering high accuracy and business interpretability.

## 📌 Overview

A credit score prediction system that leverages customer financial data to assess their creditworthiness using machine learning. This can help financial institutions minimize loan default risks and make faster, data-driven decisions.

---

## 🧾 Dataset

- Format: `.csv`
- Records: 100,000 customer data entries
- Features include:
  - Demographics: Age, Occupation
  - Financial: Annual Income, Monthly Salary, EMI, Debt, Credit History
  - Behavioral: Delayed Payments, Credit Inquiries, Credit Mix, etc.
- Target Variable: `Credit_Score` (Poor = 0, Standard = 1, Good = 2)

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
